Synth-BOT-2.0 is a remake of the original using the latest discord js and distube js packages and has some new commands.

**Commands list:**
**cringe** - cringe gif  
**destiny** - gif from one of Illidan's cinematics  
**prune** - clears X number of messages from the chat or you can also specify a target and clear X amount from their messages only (requires manage_messages permissions unless you add specific roles/members that can use it in the integrations tab)  
**avatar** - returns the avatar picture of the targeted person  
**weather** - returns the weather of the specified location  
**remind** - reminds you about X in X time.

Music system with youtube/soundcloud/spotify, commands are self explanatory(play,pause,resume,skip,loop,shuffle,autoplay,stop,dc(disconnect))  
~~Invite the bot to your server - https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=914168825111531640&permissions=3156992&scope=bot%20applications.commands~~ Not hosting the bot online any longer

~~**HOW TO RUN**~~ I've stopped support of the bot, you won't be able to run it anymore, or at least not without fixing the errors.
1. Open discord developer portal
2. Click **New Application**
3. Copy application ID and paste it in the config.json file
4. Go to Bot>Reset token>Copy token>paste it in config.json
5. Install nodejs and dependencies>run the bot(code.js main file)
6. Go to OAuth2>Scopes>select bot, below that go to bot permissions>select administrator>go to the generated url and add the bot to your server

**It might take a while to register the bot's commands**
